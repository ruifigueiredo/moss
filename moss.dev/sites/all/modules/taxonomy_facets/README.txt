INTRO
==========

Taxonomy terms are used as Facets that will help users to filter content 
progressively. Similar to what the Faceted Search module does and similar 
to most good eCommerce sites, like Amazon. However this module is all 
about SEO, so unlike the Faceted Search module this module maintains clean 
URL's with each filter change. For example, if user applies the filters: 
Computer Monitors, Samsung, LCD, then the URL will look something like: 
http://sitename.com/products/computer-monitors/samsung/lcd 

Filters can be applied in various permutations, so producing clean URL 
for each unique filter combination will allow search engines to index 
a huge amount of landing pages.

Also, the Faceted Search module is not planned to be ported to 
Drupal 7 (whereas this module is a Drupal 7 module).
When a user arrives on the site via this URL, then the correct filters will 
be applied automatically and menu items will be highlighted / opened 
accordingly.
This module produces "menus" on the fly, i.e no need for rebuilding menus 
or indexing as the menu items are not Drupal menu items but just items in the 
block. This is useful for sites where taxonomies may change frequently.

Blocks are cached for performance.

INSTALLATION
============

1) Place this module directory in your "modules" folder (this will usually be
   "sites/all/modules/"). Don't install your module in Drupal core's "modules"
   folder, since that will cause problems and is bad practice in general. If
   "sites/all/modules" doesn't exist yet, just create it.

2) Enable the Taxonomy Faceted navigation module in Drupal at:
   administration -> site configuration -> modules (admin/build/modules)
   The Drupal core taxonomy module is required.
   
 3) IMPORTANT: this module will not work with default URL alias patterns for 
 Taxonomies, see "Configure URL alias patterns" section below
 
HOW TO USE
===========
If you do not have any taxonomies in your system create some. Set them to
be included as facets by clicking "Select to include this vocabulary into 
Taxo Faceted Navigation" check box. For example create a vocabulary Catalog, 
create some terms in this vocabulary, for example

Catalog
   Monitors
     LCD
     TFT
   Laptops
   Workstations
 
 Create another 2 vocabularies
 
 Brand
   Sony
   HP
   Acer
   
 Price range
  less than $100
  $100 - $200
  $200 - $500
  $500 - $1000
  $1000 +
  
Set URL aliases. Either install Pathauto module and generate URL aliases or set
 aliases manually. 
This module will not work without URL aliases
   
Add some nodes in to your CMS and tag them with appropriate taxonomies: Lets 
say you have Product content type. Add 3 fields to the product content type. 
Field type is Term Reference. 
Add fields Catalog, Brand and Price range, of type Term Reference, and select 
appropriate Vocabularies respectively.

Create some Products and associate with appropriate terms. For Example add 
Product node Sony
LCD monitor that costs $400 and associate it with:
 Product-LCD
 Brand-Sony
 Price range - ($200 - $500)
 
   
CONFIGURATION
=============

* Expose taxonomy as Faceted Navigation blocks
------------------------
Go to Blocks admin page:
Administration » Structure » Blocks
and create Taxo Faceterd block by clicking on "Add taxofaceted block" link.
Select desired taxonomy in the Taxonomy drop down field.

* Include blocks 
-----------------
Include this block in your theme block settings:
Administration » Structure » Blocks.
The block will appear appeare in disabled section and will be 
titled:
Taxo Faceted Filter: <taxonomy name>
Include block in a desired region and order block as usual. You can oweride
the default block title (which is Taxonomy name) by filing the title filed of
the block.

* Set first argument
--------------------
Go to admin section: 
Configuration >> SEARCH AND METADATA >> Taxo Faceted Navigation 
( admin/config/search/tax_faceted_nav )
Setting up of the first argument in the url is necessary for the working of 
this module. 
For example, if this is an ecommerce site the argument could be store, so URL 
would look something like http://yoursite.com/store/hardware/monitors. 
Can not be null. Be careful not to use a word generated by token already 
used to generate clean url.s'

* IMPORTANT: Configure URL alias patterns (if Pathauto module is installed)
----------------------------------------
Go to: 
Administration > Configuration > Search and metadata > URL aliases >Patterns
In the TAXONOMY TERM PATHS section configure term patterns, change it to 
single argument, for example change default pattern: 
[term:vocabulary]/[term:name] to [term:name]. 
You can use [term:vocabulary]-[term:name] or similar, the key is to NOT have 
any / character in the pattern, as this module expects a single argument for 
each filter.

If you already have aliases generated with a different pattern update them:
Delete aliases for taxonomy terms
Bulk update taxonomy term paths 

* Configure other options
--------------------------
Go to admin section: 
Configuration >> SEARCH AND METADATA >> Taxo Faceted Navigation 
( admin/config/search/tax_faceted_nav )
Configure as desired

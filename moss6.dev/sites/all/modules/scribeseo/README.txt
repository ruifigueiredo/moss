DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
Scribe makes SEO Copywriting Simple.

Scribe is an SEO software service for Drupal - think of it as a content optimization assistant - that analyzes web pages at the click of a button.

Scribe then tells web writers of any kind how to tweak their content to get more search engine traffic, all while maintaining quality reader-focused copy.

Scribe adds a fieldset to the node edit forms with an Analyze Content button. When clicked the, the module sends your body, title, meta description and URL to the Scribe Analysis sever and returns recommendations on how to better optimize each of your content areas. 

Scribe is also available for Joomla, WordPress and as a stand-alone web application.
